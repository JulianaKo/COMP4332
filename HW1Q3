#Q3 Write SQL Codes using scenario 2(a)
#(a) For each user, find the average charge they paid for a movie
select W.uid, avg (W.charge)
from watch W

#(b) Find mid, mname watched by user named 'Raymond', from '2018-02-03 09:00:00' to '2018-02-17 17:00:00'

#(c) Find the names of all users who have watched all movies with names starting with 'Star Wars'
create view StarWars
